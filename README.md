## Contribution policy

For any changes, please create a feature branch and open a PR for it when you feel it's ready to merge. Even if there's no real disagreement about a PR, at least one other person on the team needs to look over a PR before merging. The purpose of this review requirement is to ensure shared knowledge of the app and its changes and to take advantage of the benefits of working together changes without any single person being a bottleneck to making progress.

## Getting Started

This is a Ruby on Rails app that uses Postgres since we'll likely depend on Postgres features around geolocation.
Ruby and Rails versions are specified in the project's .ruby-version and Gemfile.

Postgres installation instructions are [here](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides)

If you have Ruby and Postgres installed, clone this repository.
Then run:
```
bundle install
bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:migrate
```
